[1](# "ref")
Everyone who believes that Jesus <br>
is the Christ has been born of God,

and everyone who loves the Father <br>
loves whoever has been born of him.

[1 John 5:1 (ESV) (p.1/5)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Christ: "I am" (John)
+ born: John 3, Gal Hagar
+ believe &rArr; born
  + love God &rArr; love those born

---
[2](# "ref")
By this we know that we love <br>
the children of God,

when we love God <br>
and obey his commandments.

[3](# "ref")
For this is the love of God,<br>
that we keep his commandments.

[1 John 5:2-3 (ESV) (p.2/5)](# "ref")

>>>
+ John: love Jesus iff obey commands
+ love God + obey cmd &rArr; love those born

---
And his commandments <br>
are not burdensome.

[4](# "ref")
For everyone who has been born of God<br>
overcomes the world.

[1 John 5:3-4 (ESV) (p.3/5)](# "ref")

>>>
+ burden: heavy (vs glory? )
+ burden || world? 
  + struggle w/sin
  + world + passions pass away (ch1)
+ internal struggle: Ro7
+ born &rArr; victorious

---
And this is the victory <br>
that has overcome the world â€” our faith.

[5](# "ref")
Who is it that overcomes the world <br>
except the one who believes <br>
that Jesus is the Son of God?

[1 John 5:4-5 (ESV) (p.4/5)](# "ref")

>>>
+ faith: not power of conviction
+ believe &rArr; victorious

---
[12](# "ref")
Whoever has the Son has life;

whoever does not have the Son of God <br>
does not have life.
